# Flash the image and run the system.
#
# The image from the build needs to be transfered to the BMC so
# it can be flashed. For this lab, we'll use an NFS mount on the
# LCB to enable that transfer.

1. scp the image to the LCB
   pc$ scp op-build/output/images/palmetto.pnor <user>@<lcb ip>:<mount path>

2. In one window/tab/session connect to the BMC serial port. This may be a
direct connection to your PC, or it may be through a terminal concentration.
If necessary, log in to the terminal concentrator and connect using using <serial ip>
Example:
   pc$ telnet 9.3.23.242 2003

3. Mount the LCB on your <device> BMC
   bmc$ mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=2,nolock <lcb ip>:<mount path> /mnt

3. Flash the image
   bmc$ pflash -E -f -p /mnt/palmetto.pnor

8. Connect to the console port. This is either directly connected via <host serial>
or connected to a terminal concentrator:
   pc$ telnet <console ip>

5. Once the image is flashed, run it
   bmc$ power --off && power --on $$ power --boot

# Output will be on the console

# The "edit-compile-test" cycle looks like this:

 pc$ <edit files>
 pc$ op-build openpnor-pnor-rebuild
 pc$ scp op-build/output/images/palmetto.pnor <lcb ip>:<mount point>
 bmc$ pflash -E -f -p /mnt/palmetto.pnor
 bmc$ power --off && power --on && power --boot
