# The goal of this lab is to introduce you to patching from github.
# Because hostboot does not presently default to console tracing,
# I maintain a patch on github which enables console tracing.

1. Download the console patch from github:
   https://github.com/brs332/hostboot/commit/670688f2180101ecf2d255c538121bf94f6d72ae.patch

2. Place it in <open-power tree>/op-build/openpower/package/hostboot/hostboot-01-consoletrace.patch

3. Remove the hostboot build tree and rebuild the pnor
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/hostboot-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
   pc$ op-build openpower-pnor-rebuild
