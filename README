A handful of lab exercises, used for OpenPOWER training.

To complete these labs, you'll need the following:

1. Access to wn open-power platform; Palmetto, Habanero, etc.
 - This will be noted in the labs as <device>

2. A serial port connection to the BMC of the <device>
 - This will be noted in the labas a <bmc serial>
 - Commands issued using this interface will be prefaced by a prompt
   which looks like "bmc$" When you see a command using this prompt
   it is intended to be issued via the BMC serial port.

3. A serial port connection to the Console of the <device>
 - This will be noted in the labas a <host serial>

4. If the serial ports are connected to a terminal concentrator you will
need the IP address and port numbers for the connections.
 - These will be noted in the labs as <serial ip> and <console ip>

5. The IP address of your LCB. In the labs, this is noted as <lcb ip>
 - Commands issued using this interface are noted with the prompt "lcb$"
 - Note: the Cronus tool runs on the LCB, and Cronus commands are
   issued via the LCB. Cronus commands are differentiated from LCB
   system commands with the prompt "cronus$"

6. A user id with which to log in to the LCB. This is noted as <user>.

7. The IP address of the FSP debug box connected to the <device>. You trainer
will give you the user and password to log in to the FSP.
 - This will be notes as <fsp ip>
 - It's prompt is noted as "fsp$"

8. A computer with IP network access to the above addresses. Preferably this
is the device which was/will be used to perform the open-power build.
 - This will be noted in the labs as <pc>
 - It's prompt is noted as "pc$"

9. You will need space on the LCB to transfer images. This is typically
an exported mount point. This will be noted as <mount path>
 - Example /fspmount/bmc
 - So <lcb ip>:<mount path> might be something like 9.3.1.42:/fspmount/bmc

10. All open-power source paths are relative to the "top" of your open-power
tree.
  - Example: You cloned in to /home/users/brian/open-power and so
    pc$ ls /home/users/brian/open-power
    op-build
    pc$ ls /home/users/brian/open-power/op-build
    buildroot  dl  LICENSE  NOTICE  op-build-env  openpower  output  README
    pc$ ls /home/users/brian/open-power/op-build/openpower
    Config.in  configs  external.mk  package  platform
    pc$
 - This last path will be represented in the labs as op-build/openpower
   leaving the leading /home/users/brian/open-power off.

11. Versions of source code in open-power are noted by git commit numbers.
These are large strings of letters and numbers which make their way in to
the build tree as a way of identifying which version of code was built.
 - Example
   pc$ ls op-build/output/build/hostboot-*
   output/build/hostboot-1300dc02979646be65a39097f86a559cf68bcfb7
   ...
   pc$
 - The string 1300dc02979646be65a39097f86a559cf68bcfb7 is the "hostboot" version
   and coresponds to the git commit used to build the hostboot tree.

This number will change, and so in the labs it is noted as <commit>
 - Example
   pc$ rsync -rvtlz op-build/output/build/hostboot-<commit>

   would become

   pc$ rsync -rvtlz op-build/output/build/hostboot-1300dc02979646be65a39097f86a559cf68bcfb7

12. You will need the Cronus target name of your FSP debug box. This is noted
as <cronus target>.
