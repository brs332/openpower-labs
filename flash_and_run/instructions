# Flash the image and run the system.
#
# The image from the build needs to be transfered to the BMC so
# it can be flashed. For this lab, we'll use an NFS mount on the
# LCB to enable that transfer.

1. Mount the LCB on your Linux VM, or scp the image to the LCB
   pc$ sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=2,nolock <lcb ip address>:/fspmount /mnt
   - or -
   pc$ scp op-build/output/images/palmetto.pnor <lcb ip address>:/fspmount ...

2. In one window/tab/session log in to the BMC using the <bmc ip address>
   pc$ telnet <bmc telnet address>
3. Flash the image
   bmc$ pflash -E -f -p <mount>:<image>

4. In another window/tab/session log in to console
   pc$ telnet <console telnet address>

5. Once the image is flashed, run it
   bmc$ power --off && power --on $$ power -boot

# Output will be on the console

# The "edit-compile-test" cycle looks like this:

 pc$ <edit files>
 pc$ op-build openpnor-pnor-rebuild
 pc$ scp op-build/output/images/palmetto.pnor <lcb ip address>:/fspmount ...
 bmc$ pflash -E -f -p <mount>:<image>
 bmc$ power --off && power --on && power --boot
