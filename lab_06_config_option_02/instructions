# In this lab we'll modify palmetto.config and examine the code and runtime
# behavior.

1. Copy palmetto.config to op-build/openpower/configs/hostboot/palmetto.config
   pc$ cp palmetto.config ../../op-build/openpower/configs/hostboot/palmetto.config

2. Find the file gpiodd.o

2. Rebuild
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/hostboot-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
   pc$ op-build openpower-pnor-rebuild

3. Find the file gipodd.o

# Do we want to run this and see what happens?

4. To revert, git checkout op-build/openpower/configs/hostboot/palmetto.config

Question: Look inside palmetto.config, and notice GPIODD has
been changed. Where in the code is this used? Are there other config options
related to it?
