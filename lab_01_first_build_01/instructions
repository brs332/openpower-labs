# In this lab you will build the open-power tree. Because
# downloading some of the pieces takes a long time, we have
# provided a USB stick with the large downloads on it.

1. Go to https://github.com/open-power, have a look around.
2. In open-power/op-build/README, you'll find the build instructions
3. Lets follow them ...

# It is recommended that you create a build.log - it does not happen
automatically.

Once the build is complete, continue:

# Lets clean the build, turn on verbose output and build again

1. Clean
   pc$ rm -rf output/build/hostboot-<commit>

2. To turn on the verbose build, edit op-build/openpower/package/hostboot/hostboot.mk

 HOSTBOOT_ENV_VARS=$(TARGET_MAKE_ENV) \
     CONFIG_FILE=$(BR2_EXTERNAL)/configs/hostboot/$(BR2_HOSTBOOT_CONFIG_FILE) \
-    OPENPOWER_BUILD=1 CROSS_PREFIX=$(TARGET_CROSS) HOST_PREFIX="" HOST_BINUTILS_DIR=$(HOST_BINUTILS_DIR)
+    BUILD_VERBOSE=1 \
+    OPENPOWER_BUILD=1 CROSS_PREFIX=$(TARGET_CROSS) HOST_PREFIX="" HOST_BINUTILS_DIR=$(HOST_BINUTILS_DIR)

3. Rebuild
   pc$ op-build hostboot-rebuild openpower-pnor-rebuild

4. To revert,
   edit op-build/openpower/package/hostboot/hostboot.mk and remove
   the BUILD_VERBOSE environment variable
   pc$ rm -rf output/build/hostboot-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
