# In this lab you will learn how to grab a different commit from the
# open-power tree. Sometimes there are different commit levels you
# may need - for example, an older release or a new testing release

1. Skiboot told us to use "the latest commit"
   # What's in it?

2. Go to github and find that commit
   # Go to https://github.com/open-power/skiboot
   # Expand the latest commit number by clicking on it to expand
   # Look around - how do you find other commits?

3. Edit buildroot/firmware/skiboot/skiboot.mk, and change the version to match
   the commit skiboot told us to use (or in this case, the latest)

   (Below is just an example - the commit numbers will be different)

-SKIBOOT_VERSION = 7a790f211b2e79dcb49b650128d50f2f39c4edde
+SKIBOOT_VERSION = 7d20aac37062d93e15a96008158e51b9bbb34684
 SKIBOOT_SITE = $(call github,open-power,skiboot,$(SKIBOOT_VERSION))

4. Remove the build artifacts
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/skiboot-<commit>

5. Rebuild
   pc$ op-build skiboot-rebuild openpower-pnor-rebuild
