# In this lab we'll change the palmetto.config and investigate the changes

1. Copy palmetto.config to op-build/openpower/configs/hostboot/palmetto.config

2. Rebuild
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/hostboot-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
   pc$ op-build openpower-pnor-rebuild

3. Flash the image, and reboot the device

4. To revert,
   pc$ git checkout op-build/openpower/configs/hostboot/palmetto.config
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/hostboot-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
   pc$ op-build openpower-pnor-rebuild

Question: Look inside palmetto.config, and notice MVPD_READ_FROM_PNOR has
been changed. Where in the code is this used? Are there other config options
related to it? What happened when the code was run? Is this what you expected?
