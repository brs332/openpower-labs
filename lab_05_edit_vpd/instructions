# In this labe we'll edit a binary flash partition, recreate
# the flash image, flash the device and check that our
# change has been embedded in the ROM
#
# Also, we'll use an alternative method for passing changes to
# buildroot - a local repository rather than a patch.

1. Make a fork of hostboot-binaries and clone it
2. pc$ vi cvpd.bin, and turn it in to hex using :%!xxd
3. Edit something, anything ...
4. Turn it back in to binary with :%!xxd

Notice: buildroot can not patch binaries, so we need to
use the local git repo

# Commit the changes to your local tree
1. pc$ git status, notice cvpd.bin has changed
2. pc$ git add cvpd.bin
3. pc$ git commit -m "VPD training changes"

# Tell buildroot to use your tree
1. edit op-build/openpower/package/hostboot-binaries/hostboot-binaries.mk

-HOSTBOOT_BINARIES_VERSION = ff413007856b29b351250d63cce8996489083d26
-HOSTBOOT_BINARIES_SITE = $(call github,open-power,hostboot-binaries,$(HOSTBOOT_BINARIES_VERSION))

+HOSTBOOT_BINARIES_SITE = /home/bsilver/open-power-training/hostboot-binaries
+HOSTBOOT_BINARIES_SITE_METHOD = local

3. Rebuild
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/hostboot-binaries-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
   pc$ op-build openpower-pnor-rebuild

5. copy image to BMC, and
   bmc$ pflash -E -f -p <image>

# Check the image for your changes

1. Look at the flash table-of-contents
   bmc$ pflash -i

1. To read a partition from the pnor,
   bmc$ pflash -P CVPD --size 0x48000 --read /mnt/training.cvpd.bin

2. To have a look at the hex, on the BMC
   bmc$ hexdump -C /mnt/training.cvpd.bin | less

Question: How do you get the read partition onto your PC and look at it there?

# To revert all of these changes:

1. In hostboot-binaries, you have a commit - we want to get rid of that:
   pc$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
   pc$ git reset HEAD cvpd.bin
   pc$ git checkout cvpd.bin

2. We need to clean up the changes to hostboot-binaries.mk, too
   pc$ git checkout openpower/package/hostboot-binaries/hostboot_binaries.mk
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/hostboot-binaries-<commit>
   pc$ rm -rf op-build/output/build/openpower-pnor-<commit>
   pc$ op-build openpower-pnor-rebuild
